I am Yaoxuan Wu, a third-year CS PhD at UCLA, advised by Miryung Kim. My research interests span over on security, database and program testing.


Prior to joining UCLA, I completed my undergrad in Turing Class, Peking University. During my undergrad years, I was also fortunate to work with Xin Zhang at Peking University.
